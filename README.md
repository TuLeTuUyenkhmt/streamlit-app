**Air Quality Forecasting of CO2 Emission (Global)**

Objective : 
- To forecast CO2 levels for an organization so that the organization can follow government norms with respect to CO2 emission levels.
- Given data of CO2 emission of the world from 1800 to 2014. The aim is to study the data and predict the CO2 emission for next 10 years. 

Work Flow :
- Data Analysis and drawing up some inferences. 
- Implementation of various EDA techniques to clean the data and visualized it using different graphs.
- Future prediction had to be done using 'Time Series Analysis & Forecasting' technique. 
- Model Deployement using Streamlit API and Streamlit Cloud.
